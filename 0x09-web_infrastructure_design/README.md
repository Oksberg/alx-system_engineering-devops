#0x09. Web infrastructure design
In this project, we explore the basics and some mid-level setups of a web infrastructure design.
We look into the components of a server, and how a web server, an application server, code base and the database work together to satisfy the user.
We learn about SPOF, QPS, LAMP stack. We also learn about how load balancers help a server system run efficiently.
